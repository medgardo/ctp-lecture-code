# Module 07 - Lecture Code

## 01 - Responding with JSON

In this lecture we looked at API's that respond with JSON and XML. Here we develop a simple app that responds with JSON. The key is to use the `res.json(object)` express function.

To view the results, run the app, and visit the following two endpoints:

* [http://localhost:8000/api/phones](http://localhost:8000/api/phones)
* [http://localhost:8000/api/persons](http://localhost:8000/api/persons)
